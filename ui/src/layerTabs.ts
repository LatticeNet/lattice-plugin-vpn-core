/**
 * Keeps the selected layer tab in view.
 *
 * Below 620px the layer row is a segmented control that scrolls sideways and
 * is wider than a phone. A link or a reload onto a later layer (Attention,
 * Files, Shares) left its tab cut off or off screen, so the page did not say
 * which layer it was on. The row scrolls itself to show the selected tab on
 * mount and whenever the selection changes, and at no other time: a re-render
 * for anything else (the proof line's age ticks every second) must not snap
 * back a row the operator is swiping through.
 *
 * Only the row scrolls. scrollIntoView would also scroll the page and, in a
 * frame, the console around it.
 *
 * The same file as lattice-plugin-sub-store/ui/src/layerTabs.ts.
